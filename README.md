All of the models are located in /Models
to run a particular model, navigate to that folder via commandline, then run the proper file
for Logistic Regression: altLogistic.py
for MLP: MLP.py
for Support VectorMachine: altSVM.py
for Naive Bayes:  First run Generator.py then run Tester.py (the results may not be sensible.)
